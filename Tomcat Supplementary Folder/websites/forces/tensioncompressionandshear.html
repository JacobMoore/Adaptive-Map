<h1>Tension, Compression and Shear</h1>
<hr/>

<p>For discussion of tension, compression and shear we will start with an example.  Imagine a box, this box has two forces acting on it and the box is in equilibrium.  This means that the two forces acting on the box are equal in magnitude, but opposite in direction.  Now we increase these forces until the box breaks in some way.  There are a few ways we can set up these forces to break the box in different ways.</p>

<p>The first is <b>tension</b>.  Tension is when the two forces have the same line of action and they are pulling on the box in opposite directions.  If the box is deformable, increasing tension forces will stretch the box more and more until the box is torn into two pieces.</p>

<p>Next is <b>compression</b>.  Compression is when the two forces have the same line of action and they are squishing the two ends of the box together.  If the box is deformable, increasing the compression forces will begin flattening the box more and more until cracks form and the box crumbles.</p>

</div>

<p>Finally we have <b>shear</b>.  Shear occurs when there are forces in opposite directions that do not have the same line of action.  This will tend to rotate the box, but if the box is not allowed to rotate because of other forces or moments then we have shear force.  If the box is deformable, increasing the shear forces will skew the box more and more, making the box into a parallelogram.  Eventually a crack will form, splitting the box into two pieces.</p>

<p>A part may experience tension, compression and shear in combination.  For example, a part may be in tension in one direction and compression in another.  A part can also be in tension and shear in the same direction.  The only thing a part cannot do is have tension and compression in the same direction since forces with the same line of action cannot be both towards each other and away from each other.</p>

<h4>The Effect of Materials and Geometries:</h4>

<p>The concepts of tension compression and shear are important because bodies often react differently to tension, compression and shear loading conditions.  Depending on the material and the geometry of the part there can be vastly different strengths for the different types of loading.  If a part is able to withstand 500 lbs of tensile force for example, that does not mean it can necessarily withstand 500 lbs of compressive force.</p>

<p>Some bodies cannot support any loading of some types.  For example, you can pull something with a rope (putting the rope in tension), but if you tried to push something with a rope (putting the rope in compression) the rope would just coil up.  The rope is not able to support any compressive loading.</p>

<h4>The Effect of Materials:</h4>

<p>Some materials, such as steel, are fairly uniform in their resistance to tension, compression and shear.  Other materials, such as asphalt, are fairly resistant to one type of loading (compression in this case) but are very weak under the other conditions (tension and shear).  The ultimate tensile, compressive and shear strength of a material are quantitative measures of each materials resistance to breaking under the given loading conditions.</p>

<h4>Effect of Part Geometries:</h4>

<p>The geometry of a part also has an effect on the maximum tensile, compressive and shear load a part can support.  To explore this concept, you can use a piece of uncooked spaghetti.  To break the spaghetti in compression, you would push on both ends of the spaghetti until the spaghetti broke into two pieces.  This should be fairly easy to do.  Next use a piece of spaghetti half as long as the original piece and break this in compression.  Try using pieces one quarter as long as the original or one eighth or even one sixteenth as long as the original piece.  You should notice that as the pieces of spaghetti get shorter, they become more difficult to break.  The length of the spaghetti affects how much compressive load the spaghetti can take before breaking.  Similar part geometry and strength relationships are common.  More on this will be discussed in later courses on deformable bodies.</p>
