<h1>Principle of Transmissability</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The principle of transmissibility states that the point of application of a force can be moved anywhere along its line of action and it will have the same effect for <b>external forces</b> of a <b>rigid body</b>.  Any force that has the same magnitude and direction, and which has a point of application somewhere along the same line of action will cause the same acceleration and will result in the same moment.  Therefore, the points of application of forces can be moved up and down the line of action to simplify the analysis of rigid bodies.</p>

<div class="caption">
All of the above diagrams show equivalent force systems, where the points of application of the forces have been moved along the line of action.</br>
</div>
</div>

<p>Moving the point of application does affect internal forces however.  Because internal forces are affected by the point of application, the principle of transmissibility cannot be applied to problems analyzing the internal forces of bodies.  Also because the deformation of bodies is dependent upon the internal forces, the principle of transmissibility cannot be applied to deformable bodies.  </p>

<div class="caption">
With the two forces shown being equal and opposite, both systems are in equilibrium.  Therefore for static analysis, the force that has moved between the two diagrams is equivalent with either point of application.  Each point of application creates different internal forces however which would deform the body in different ways.</br>
