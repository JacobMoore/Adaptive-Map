<h1>Newton's Second Law</h1>
<hr/>

<p>Newton's Second Law of Motion states that the net force acting on a body is equal to mass of the body times the acceleration of that body.</p>

<p>In the equation above, the force acting on the object and the acceleration of the object are vectors (they have both a magnitude and a direction.)  Mass on the other hand is a scalar value that has a magnitude, but no direction.</p>

<p>Newton's Second Law of Motion can also be applied to rotational systems.  The rotational equivalent of Newton's Second law states that the moment acting on a body is equal to the second mass moment of that body around the axis of rotation (I) times the angular acceleration.</p>

<p>As with the first equation, the moment and the angular accelerations are both vectors that have both a magnitude and a direction and the second mass moment is a scalar value with a magnitude but no direction.  Unlike the first equation though, the second mass moment is dependent upon the axis of rotation of the object.  It is therefore important to ensure that the second mass moment used matches the direction of the moment and angular acceleration vectors.</p>
