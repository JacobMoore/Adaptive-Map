<h1>Bodies</h1>
<hr/>

<p>A body, for the purposes of engineering, is a collection of matter that is analyzed as a single object.  In most cases a body refers to a solid object (rather than a liquid or a gas).</p>

<p>Bodies can be characterized by their mass and the distribution of this mass, which determines how forces an moments will affect the body.  The mass of a body is a measure of that object's resistance to changes in momentum due to forces.  The Second Mass Moment of Inertia is a measure of a body's resistance to changes in angular momentum due to moments, and is dependent upon the distribution of the mass and the axis of rotation.</p>

<h4>Particles versus Extended Bodies:</h4>

<p>Particles are bodies where all the mass is concentrated at a single point in space.  Extended bodies on the other hand have mass that is distributed throughout a finite volume.  In actuality, no bodies are truly particles, but some bodies can be approximated as particles for the purposes of analysis.  If all forces acting on a body act through the center of mass of that body has no moments are applied the body, it can be approximated as a particle for analysis; a particle with a mass equal to the mass of the extended body located at the center of mass of the extended body.</p>

<p>Particles are simpler to analyze than extended bodies because all forces must act through the center of mass (since forces not acting on this point are not acting on the object.)  Because of this not moments can be exerted on the object and the moment equations can be left out of the analysis.</p>

<h4>Rigid versus Deformable Bodies:</h4>

<p>Rigid bodies do not deform (stretch, compress, or bend) when forces or moments are applied to them.  Deformable bodies do deform when forces or moments are applied to them.  In actuality, no physical body is truly rigid, but most objects deform so little that bodies can be approximated as rigid bodies for analysis.  The methods used in engineering statics assume that all bodies are rigid.  How deformable bodies react to forces will be covered in a mechanics of materials class.</p>
