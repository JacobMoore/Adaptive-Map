<h1>Newton's Third Law</h1>
<hr/>

<p>Newton's Third Law states that for any action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.  By "action" Newton means a force, so for every force one body exerts on another body, that second body exerts a force of equal magnitude but opposite direction back on the first body.  Since all forces are exerted by bodies (either directly or indirectly), all forces come in pairs, one acting on each of the bodies interacting.</p>

<p>In the diagram above we can see pairs of equal and opposite forces.  For the planetary bodies on the left, the gravity force exerted by the earth on the moon is equal and opposite of the gravity force exerted by the moon on the earth.  For the box on the right there are two sets of equal and opposite forces.  The downward gravity force exerted by the earth (the surface) on the box is equal and opposite of the upward gravity force exerted by the box on the earth.  In addition, the upward normal force exerted by the earth on the box is equal and opposite to the downward normal force exerted by the box on the earth.</p>
