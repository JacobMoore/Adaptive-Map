<h1>Normal Force</h1>
<hr/>

<p>Normal forces are the intermolecular forces that prevent any two bodies from occupying the same space at the same time.  Normal forces only occur when two bodies are in direct contact.  Whenever two bodies are in contact, normal forces are exerted at the point of contact of the two bodies, pushing those two bodies apart.  As indicated by name, normal forces are always normal (perpendicular) to the surfaces where the bodies contact one another.</p>

<p>Above are diagrams showing some normal forces that are exerted between two bodies in contact with one another.  Wherever two bodies contact one another, there is a normal force.  As you can see, the normal forces come in equal and opposite pairs where each body exerts a force on the other body.</p>

<p>The magnitude of the normal force is equal to the force required to prevent the two contacting bodies accelerating into one another.  As shown in the examples below, if a box is sitting on a table a gravitational force will push that box downward (A).  To counter this downward force, the table will exert a normal force upwards with a magnitude equal to the weight of the box.  If someone were to push down on top of the box with a 5N force (B), the upwards normal force exerted by the table would increase by 5N.  Similarly, if someone were to pull upwards on the box with a force of 5N, the normal force would decrease to the weight minus 5N.</p>
