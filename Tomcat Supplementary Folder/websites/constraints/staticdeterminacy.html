<h1>Static Determinacy</h1>
<hr/>

<p>Bodies or systems of bodies can either be statically determinate or statically indeterminate.  A body or a system of bodies is said to be statically determinate, if it is possible to solve for all of the unknown forces using the equations of static equilibrium.  A body or system of bodies is said to be statically indeterminate if you are unable to solve for all unknowns using the equations of static equilibrium.  Static determinacy is a measure of the solvability of a system in engineering statics, where statically determinate systems are solvable and statically indeterminate systems are unsolvable.</p>

<p>The equations of equilibrium for statically indeterminate bodies generally have more unknowns to solve for than separate equations.  When this occurs, the laws and theories describing the mechanics of static, rigid structures cannot be used to determine the forces acting on the body.  To solve statically indeterminate systems, you often need to drop the assumption of rigidity and use the laws and theories concerning the mechanics of deformable bodies to generate additional equations.  The mechanics of deformable bodies is covered in later courses, so until that information is covered, statically indeterminate systems are unsolvable.</p>

<p>Below is an example of a beam that is statically determinate on the left and a similar beam that is statically indeterminate on the right.  The statically determinate beam has three unknown forces acting on it while the statically indeterminate beam has four unknown forces acting on it.  Because we can only generate three equilibrium equations for each of the beams, the equations for the beam with four unknown forces acting on cannot be solved.  There are an infinite number of possible solutions.  This makes the beam with four unknown forces acting on it a statically indeterminate system.</p>

The example on the left is a statically determinant system.  It has three unknown forces (shown in red) and there are three possible equilibrium equations to use.  The example on the right is a statically indeterminate system.  It has four unknowns (also shown in red) making some of the forces (F<sub>1Y</sub> , F<sub>2Y</sub> and F<sub>3Y</sub> ) have an infinite number of possible solutions.

<h4>Static Determinacy and Constraints:</h4>

<p>Static determinacy is linked to the constraints acting on a system.  Systems that are statically determinate have no overconstrained bodies, while systems that are statically indeterminate have one or more bodies that are overconstrained.  Overconstrained bodies by definition have more forces acting on the body than is necessary to prevent a body from moving.  It is the "extra" unknown forces that lead to a set of unsolvable equilibrium equations.</p>

<p>Unconstrained or partially constrained bodies can be statically determinate.  As long as a body is not overconstrained, it is possible to solve for the unknown forces.  These systems may lead to fewer unknown forces than possible equilibrium equations, which still allows you to solve for the unknown forces.  It is important to take caution with unconstrained and partially constrained systems though as they may contain accelerating bodies.  If bodies are accelerating, the body is not in static equilibrium and the equations of static equilibrium will not lead to valid solutions, even if they can be solved. </p>
