<h1>Vector Decomposition</h1>

The blue vector can be decomposed into the two red vectors.

</div>

<p>Every vector can be thought of as the sum of some other vectors that when added have the same direction and magnitude.  As seen on the right, the blue vector is equal to the sum of the two red vectors.  Vector decomposition is the process of breaking one vector into two or more parts that add up to the original vector.  Again looking at the picture on the right, we can say that we decomposed the blue vector into the two red vectors.</p>

<p>The most useful way to decompose vectors is to break a vector into components that line up with the coordinate axes.  A vector in a 2-D plane is broken up into an X component and a Y component.  The X component has some magnitude in the direction of the positive X axis and the Y component has some magnitude in the direction of the positive Y axis.  A vector in 3-D space will have three components, an X component, a Y component and a Z component.  The image below shows a 2-D and a 3-D vector in blue and the corresponding components of the vector in red.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>When decomposing a vector into X, Y and Z components, you will need to solve for the magnitude of each component.  To do this you will need to know the magnitude of the original vector and you will need to know the direction (one angle for a 2-D vector and two angles for a 3-D vector).  If you have this information you can use trigonometry to solve for the magnitudes of the components.  Below are the formulas for the magnitudes of the X, Y, and Z components of the vectors shown above.   Be cautioned though, these equations will only work if the angles are measured in exactly the same way as in the diagrams.</p>

</div>

<p>A vector can be represented as either a magnitude and direction, or it can be represented in component form.  In component form, the vector is listed with three values representing the magnitudes of the X, Y and Z components of the vector.  For 2-D vectors, the Z component (which will always equal zero) is often omitted.</p>
