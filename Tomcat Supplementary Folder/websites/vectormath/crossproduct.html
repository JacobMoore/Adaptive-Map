<p>The cross product is a mathematical operation that can be performed on any two three dimensional vectors.  The mathematical operation is represented by an "x" between two vectors (hence the name cross product).  Cross products are used for a number of purposes, but in statics they are primarily used to calculate moments.  The cross product of two vectors will also be a vector.  The cross product vector will be in a direction that is perpendicular to both of the two original vectors, and it will have a magnitude equal to the area of a parallelogram formed two of each of the original vectors.</p>

<p>To calculate the cross product of two vectors algebraically by hand, you can follow the procedure below.</p>

<ol>
<li>1.	First create a table that fits the following format.  In the first row write out "X, Y, Z, X, Y".  In the second row, write out the X, Y, and Z components of the first original vector, and they write out the X and Y components again.  The components should correspond to the letters above them.  Finally, in the third row, write out the components of the second vector in the same way.  The order of the vectors in a cross product matters.  Make sure you list the first vector in the second row of the table and the second vector in the second row of the table.</li>

<li>Next draw in all the diagonals that pass through three separate elements.  You can follow the diagonals to remember the cross product formula.  The cross product formula gives a value for each of the three components of the cross product.  The top row indicates the component of the cross product you are solving for.  The formula is the diagonals in blue minus the diagonals in red.</li>
