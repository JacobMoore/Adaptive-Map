<h1>Two Force Members</h1>
<hr/>

<p>A two force member is any body with only two forces acting on it in two separate locations.  No moments are exerted on two force members.  If the two force member is in static equilibrium, then the forces must be equal and opposite and they must be collinear.  Specifically they will act along the line connecting the points of application of the two forces.</p>

<h4>Proving the Forces on Two Force Members Must be Equal, Opposite and Collinear:</h4>

<p>The forces on the two force member in equilibrium must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction because the sum of the forces on a body in equilibrium is always zero.  Since there are only two forces acting on the body, the second force vector must have the same magnitude but opposite direction of the first force vector.</p>

This diagram shows two equal and opposite forces acting on a two force member.  If the forces were not collinear, they would exert a moment on the body and the body would not be in equilibrium.

</div>

<p>The forces on the two force member in equilibrium must be collinear because the sum of moments on the body must be equal to zero.  Knowing that the forces are equal and opposite, we can deduce that the forces are at least parallel.  If the forces were not collinear, they would have some perpendicular distance between them and they would be a couple, which would exert a moment on the body.  With no other forces or moments to counteract this moment, the sum of moments would not be equal to zero.  The only way the forces will not exert a moment (assuming the forces have a non-zero magnitude) is for the forces to be collinear (this makes the perpendicular distance between the forces zero and therefore prevents the forces from exerting a moment).  In order for the two forces to be collinear, they must act along the line between the two points of application.</p>

<h4>Why are Two Force Members Important:</h4>

<p>Knowing that some members of a multicomponent assembly are two force members is important for two reasons.</p>

<p>First, the forces have a known direction.  They will act along the line between the two connection points and therefore you only need to solve for one variable (the magnitude of the force).</p>

<p>Second, once you deduce the magnitude of one force acting on the two force member you know the magnitude and direction of the second (it is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction).</p>

<p>These assumptions greatly simplify the analysis of multicomponent assemblies by reducing the number of unknowns in the equations of static equilibrium.</p>
